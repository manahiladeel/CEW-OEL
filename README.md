there are two shellscript files one is use to call the Api and store the data in the raw_data.txt which is run_program2.sh

second shellscript takes the average of the data and stores it in processed_data.txt which is run_program.sh 

i want to automate the calling of the bash files run_program.sh 1 times a day and run_program2.sh 12 times a day

tried using cronjob but its not working
